# About me
Hi! My name is Favour Ojo (she/her), and I am a 2nd year MSPPM-DA student at Carnegie Mellon University. Because of my background in computer science, I have been really interested in coding and how to create different things using several types of computer softwares. After my first data analysis course with R in my undergraduate career, I started become very interested in the field of data analytics. 

I really liked the aspect of telling a story with data rather this be demographic data about a community/neighborhood, the poverty rates, or even the infrastructure data to determine if that specific community is in need. This discovery led me to continue to pursue data analytics as a career and also led me to Carnegie Mellon's MSPPM-DA graduate program. The tagline that stated they utilized "data for social good" assured me I was applying to the correct program. 

# What I hope to learn

1. Color Theory (How to properly utilize color in each visualization) 
2. Creating visulizations with different kinds of softwares 
3. How to properly critique visualizations to ensure I am creating the best charts and graphs I can
