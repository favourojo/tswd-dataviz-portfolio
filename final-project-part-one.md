# US Healthcare System - Is it Worth the Cost? 
 
The health of Americans is poor relative to residents of other wealthy nations. The U.S. healtcare system struggles with deficiencies in quality, fragmentation, and poor coordination of care; and it ranks poorly when compared with healthcare systems in other wealthy nations [1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK568874/#:~:text=The%20U.S.%20healthcare%20system%20struggles,is%20often%20tied%20to%20employment.). Higher healthare spending can be beneficial if it results in better health outcomes. However, despite higher healthcare spending, America's health outcomes are not any better than those in other developed countries [2](https://www.pgpf.org/article/how-does-the-us-healthcare-system-compare-to-other-countries/)

This project will analyze healthcare costs per capita in different countries in comparison to the United States of America.  Healthcosts per capita is the healthcare costs per each individual in a certain region. The United States has faced significant criticism because of the their high healthcare costs. On top of that, the quality of care does not justify the ammount to pay for healthcare. These costs discourage people from getting treatment which then causes their diseases to linger and worsen. Emergency services that individuals need in a quick amount of time such as ambulance services and cancer treatment are one of the most costly services in the United States. Many individuals in the US find this ridiculous, but still try to pay these costs because they feel there is no alternative.

However, healthcare costs are significantly lower in other regions in the world. Individuals are stil discouraged because they beleive the US healthcare is the best they can receive, but other countries' healthcare systems are just as efficient. I am hoping I am able to show there are suitable options to the US healthcare system and I believe the best way to show this is to display the major causes of death by country while also looking at the life epxectancy, which is also another data point that analyzes how efficient a country's healthcare system is. Additionally, I will then show the economic postion of each individual (GDP per capita) and their average health care spending. This will show how much each individual is spending on health care while also showing a measure of the people in that country's average income. 

## Project Structure

**Setup**: The United State's healthcare system reigns as the most popular healthcare system despite issues. 

**Conflict**: The United States' high healthcare costs discourages many individuals from getting the best treatment to treat their concerning illnesses.

**Resolution**: Other countries offer more accessible healthcare services and offer better quality healthcare compared to the United States. 

As a reader, I want to know what the best suitable options to the United States' healthcare system is and also other factors about their healthcare that can help an individual decide which ountry is the best for them. For instance, I would also like to know about the life expectancy in each country and also the major causes of death to understand how the regions are tackling this issue and if they are doing it efficiently.

## The data

I will be downloading a couple datasets that document how efficient the healthcare system is in a country. I will utilize the healthcare costs per capita data to show how afforadable each country's healthcare system is to show alternatives to the United States' healthcare system. That is the primary story the data will be telling. If feasible, individuals can migrate to different countries if they feel they are unable to afford the US healthcare system to treat the diseases that they have.

The dataset that includes the life expectancy of the individuals in each country represents the general health of the citizens. A lower life expectancy rate indicates that those individuals may not be properly treating the illnesses they contract rather it be mental or phsyical. A higher life expectancy rate would indicate that individuals are able to properly take care of their illness becuase their healthcare system is affordable for them to do so. The leading causes of death adds to the life expectancy data, explanining why a country's life expectancy is lower compared to other countries. 

Additionally, there is another dataset comparing the GDP per capita of different countries with the health spending per person. This data will be showing that several countries that are just as wealthy as the United States are able to offer affordable healthcare to their citizens. The addition of this daataset will add to the analysis of how similar the United States is to other countries in wealth, but fail to provide the proper healthcare to the individuals that need it the most.

## Method and medium

I plan on completing my final project by combining the sketches to create a comparative visualization of life expectancy, major causes of death, and healthcare costs per capita. I hope to be able to demosntrate the effectiveness of each country's healthcare system by examining how high or low life expectancy is, as well as whether the diseases that cuase the most fatalities are treatable. I would highlight GDP per capita and health spending per capita side-by-side to see each individual's financial status and how much they spend on healthcare on average.
