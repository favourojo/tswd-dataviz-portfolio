# US Healthcare System - Is it Worth the Cost? 
> Include a high-level summary of your project.  This should be a couple paragraphs that describe what you're interested in showing with your final project. 
 
This project will analyze healthcare costs per capita in different countries in comparison to the United States of America. Healthcosts per capita is the healthcare costs per each individual in a certain region. The United States has faced significant criticism because of the their high healthcare costs. These costs discourage people from getting treatment which then causes their diseases to linger and worsen. Emergency services that individuals need in a quick amount of time such as ambulance services and cancer treatment are one of the most costly services in the United States. MANy individuals in the US find this ridiculous, but still try to pay these costs because they feel there is no alternative.

However, healthcare costs are significantly lower in other regions in the world. Individuals are stil discouraged because they beleive the US healthcare is the best they can receive, but other countries' healthcare systems are just as efficient. I am hoping I am able to show there are suitable options compared the US healthcare system and I believe the best way to showcase this is also speak about the major causes of death by country. Life epxectancy is also another data point that analyzes how efficient a country's healthcare system is. 


> A project structure that outlines the major elements of your story.  Your Good Charts text talks about story structure in Chapter 8 - you should describe what you hope to achieve.  Make sure the outline is detailed enough that we can see how you anticipate your story unfolding.  You can incorporate your Story Arc from the in-class exercise along with your user stories and one sentence summary to make the topic even more clear. 

The United States' high healthcare costs discourages many individuals from getting the best treatment to treat their concerning illnesses, and hope for there to be an alternative. As a reader, I want to know what the best suitable options to the United States' healthcare system and also other factors about their healthcare. For instance, I would also like to know about the life expectancy in each country and also the major causes of death to understand how the regions are tackling this issue and if they are doing it efficiently. I can do this by analyzing the life expectancy by the major causes of death in a country and then compare this with the healthcare costs per capita.


## Initial sketches
> Post images of your anticipated data visualizations (sketches are fine). They should mimic aspects of your outline, and include elements of your story.

# The data
> A couple of paragraphs that document your data source(s), and an explanation of how you plan on using your data. 

I will be downloading a couple datasets that document how efficient the healthcare system is in a country. I will utilize the healthcare costs per capita data to show how afforadable each country's healthcare system is to show alternatives to the United States' healthcare system. That is the primary story the data will be telling. If feasible, individuals can migrate to different countries if they feel they are unable to afford the US healthcare system to treat the diseases that they have.

The dataset that includes the life expectancy of the individuals in each country represents the general health of the citizens. A lower life expectancy rate indicates that those individuals may not be properly treating the illnesses they contract rather it be mental or phsyical. A higher life expectancy rate would indicate that individuals are able to properly take care of their illness becuase their healthcare system is affordable for them to do so. 



> A link to the publicly-accessible datasets you plan on using, or a link to a copy of the data you've uploaded to your Github repository, Box account or other publicly-accessible location. Using a datasource that is already publicly accessible is highly encouraged.  If you anticipate using a data source other than something that would be publicly available please talk to me first.

# Method and medium
> In a few sentences, you should document how you plan on completing your final project. 

I plan on completing my final project by combing the sketches to create a comparison chart between the factors life expectancy and major causes of death with healthcare costs per capita. I am hoping to be able to show the efficiency of each country's health care system by analyzing how high or low the life expectancy is and also seeing if the diseases causing the most deaths are treatable.
