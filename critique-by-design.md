# Critique by Design

## Step one: the visualization

The data visualization I decided that to redisgn was from the [Visual Captalist website](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/ranked-2025s-best-countries-to-live-and-work/#google_vignette) in a article by Bruno Venditti called **Ranked: 2025's Best Countries to Live and Work**. 

![Top-Migration-Destinations-2025_WEB-1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3bdc77e2-4119-4711-ae3e-df9b4d708ad3)
"

I chose this data visualization because I was intrigued by the information that was in the website. More specifically, I was interested in what were the parameters that make people want to migrate to another country. I also wanted to know which countries intrigue people the most based on the factors they listed. This applies the same to the countries people may not want to migrate and why that may be. 

## Step two: the critique

I liked several things about this image when I first looked at it. I thought the visualization was useful for its intended audience of those who are looking to migrate to a new country. It showcases important factors that could intice someone to move location such as livability and economic prosperity. 

The simplicity of the data visulization was also something I liked because the audience will be able to easily relate the numbers to each category. The labeling on the x and y axis were simple and easy to read with factors and the countries. I believed at first that the visualization had everything necessary to make it understandable, but there is not a clear explanation of each parameters.

One thing I did not like about the graph was the color scaling that was used. I was confused on the use of yellow, green, and blue as the color scheme to show the difference in scoring. It is much more confusing that intutitive. I do not believe these colors are showing how high or low a number is, which is why I will be focusing on this the most in my redesign. 

## Step three: Sketch a solution
<div class='tableauPlaceholder' id='viz1762998130198' style='position: relative'><noscript><a href='#'><img alt='2025&#39;s Best Countries to Live and Work in (source: Henley Opportunity Index)Scores range from 0-100 ' src='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;20&#47;2025sBestCountriestoLiveandWorkin&#47;Sheet1&#47;1_rss.png' style='border: none' /></a></noscript><object class='tableauViz'  style='display:none;'><param name='host_url' value='https%3A%2F%2Fpublic.tableau.com%2F' /> <param name='embed_code_version' value='3' /> <param name='site_root' value='' /><param name='name' value='2025sBestCountriestoLiveandWorkin&#47;Sheet1' /><param name='tabs' value='no' /><param name='toolbar' value='yes' /><param name='static_image' value='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;20&#47;2025sBestCountriestoLiveandWorkin&#47;Sheet1&#47;1.png' /> <param name='animate_transition' value='yes' /><param name='display_static_image' value='yes' /><param name='display_spinner' value='yes' /><param name='display_overlay' value='yes' /><param name='display_count' value='yes' /><param name='language' value='en-US' /><param name='filter' value='publish=yes' /></object></div>
<script type='text/javascript'>   
  var divElement = document.getElementById('viz1762998130198');    
  var vizElement = divElement.getElementsByTagName('object')[0];   
  vizElement.style.width='100%';vizElement.style.height=(divElement.offsetWidth*0.75)+'px';  
  var scriptElement = document.createElement('script');  
  scriptElement.src = 'https://public.tableau.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js';
  vizElement.parentNode.insertBefore(scriptElement, vizElement);
</script>


I utilized Tableau to sketch my redesign and, like I said before, I focused on the the coloring the most. 

## Step four: Test the solution

Results: 

| Question | Interview 1 | Interview 2 |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| What the first thing you noticed in the map? | The red and green colors in the highlight tables | How many columns are there in the visualization |
| Can you describe what story the visualization is trying to tell | The visualization is describing the best countries to migrate to in 2025 based on the factors in the columns | I can see that the visualization is showing countries that would be the best to move to based on the different factors
| Is there anything you find surprising or confusing? | The red-green divering palette was a bit confusing to understand the difference in colors | I don't understnd what each of the columns means like "Earning potential", it seems like a general term |
| What would you change about the visualiaztion? | I would change the color palette to something that is easier to understand like a Green-Gold diverging palette for instance | The several columns make the graph clustered, maybe try to group the columns by education, economic, and livability |


Synthesis: 

A pattern I noticed in the feedback was the people I interviewed did not like the new color palette I used because the red-green diverging palette was confusing to understand the difference in numbers. Also, the phrases for the columns were not as easy to understand as I thought when I first saw the visualization. The people I interviewed stated that they wished there was more information about the columns. Similarly, they believed there were too many columns and they could be grouped to make readability better for the audience. The design changes that makes the most sense for my final redesign would be changing the color palette and grouping the columns. 

## Step five: build the solution

<div class='tableauPlaceholder' id='viz1763007289807' style='position: relative'><noscript><a href='#'><img alt='2025&#39;s Best Countries to Live and Work in (source: Henley Opportunity Index)Scores range from 0-100 ' src='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;He&#47;HenleyBestCountriestoLiveandWorkin&#47;Sheet2&#47;1_rss.png' style='border: none' /></a></noscript><object class='tableauViz'  style='display:none;'><param name='host_url' value='https%3A%2F%2Fpublic.tableau.com%2F' /> <param name='embed_code_version' value='3' /> <param name='site_root' value='' /><param name='name' value='HenleyBestCountriestoLiveandWorkin&#47;Sheet2' /><param name='tabs' value='no' /><param name='toolbar' value='yes' /><param name='static_image' value='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;He&#47;HenleyBestCountriestoLiveandWorkin&#47;Sheet2&#47;1.png' /> <param name='animate_transition' value='yes' /><param name='display_static_image' value='yes' /><param name='display_spinner' value='yes' /><param name='display_overlay' value='yes' /><param name='display_count' value='yes' /><param name='language' value='en-US' /><param name='filter' value='publish=yes' /></object></div>
<script type='text/javascript'>                    
  var divElement = document.getElementById('viz1763007289807');    
  var vizElement = divElement.getElementsByTagName('object')[0];     
  vizElement.style.width='100%';vizElement.style.height=(divElement.offsetWidth*0.75)+'px';        
  var scriptElement = document.createElement('script');                    
  scriptElement.src = 'https://public.tableau.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js';
  vizElement.parentNode.insertBefore(scriptElement, vizElement); 
</script>

I made significant changes here from my original sketch. I first decided to change the color palette from the Red-Green diverging to the Green-Gold palette. After changing it, I realized this does make the graph look much better and I feel the audience will understand the numbers better. I then decided to group the values by Economic Score, Education Score, and Livability Score and keep the Total Score . I then added a caption to describe each of the groups and the factors in the groups. This will help the readers understand the factors more and also de-cluster the visualization. Though this was not apart of the feedbcak, I did had a legend showing a range of the values. I did this because I wanted the readers to understand the color palette more and see what the range in values were.
