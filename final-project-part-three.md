# Changes made since Part II
> Include few paragraphs that reflects on changes you made since the completion of Part II. 

I made several desgin changes for the final part of the project. I did this primarily because I recevied alot of contructive feedback about the design choices I made for my visualizations and also to ensure the Shorthand was flowing properly. In order to do that, I also had to change the purpose of my project and who exactly I wanted the intended audience to be. I realized focusing on those who are frustrated with the current United States healthcare system was too broad and made trying to create a narrative difficult. The better audience for this project are policymakers who are able to make a change in the US healthcare system so that it is more affordable and accessible. 

I also changed the design and order of the Shorthand presentation. I decided to start with an introduction of the United States healthcare system speaking about the criticism and why I am using it as the focus point. I then will compare the US to other countries' healthcare by using factrs like GDP per capita, healthcare costs, and death rates. This can help individuals understand if the US healthcare costs translate into good quality of care. The flow of the Shorthand now makes sense to understand the narrative that I am trying to tell which is that the US healthcare system needs a drastic change. I decided to end with a call to action section about what policymakers should do to change the state of the US healthcare system and adding articles for clarification.

## The audience
> Talk about who you identified as the audience for your final data story.  Include any other information you've used that helped you narrow the focus (e.g. insights from your interviews, personas, etc.).  Note any specific adjustments you made to your final project to make it work for your audience.

I decided the audience of the final data story would be policymakers who are able to make a change in the US healthcare system. THe interviews I did were the most helpful for me to make this decision. The interview with my classmates that were also international students put in perspective just how different the healthcare systems were in other countries compared to the US. I decided that encourging others to move out of the US was not a relistic and strong call to action. It would be more effective to call for a more affordable healthcare system or suggest the US to cosnider a universal haelthcare system that provides access to healthcare for all citizens. 

## Final design decisions
> You can specifically break out your design decisions here, or include it under *Changes made since Part II* and delete this section. Talk about the design decisions you had to make along the way, and reflect on anything in particular that stands out to you that you learned working through the process.  Include any other information that helps round out your data story. 

I changed majority of the visualizations from Part two and I feel the narrative is being properly told. I originally had the healthcare costs as a map created from Tableau because of the fact I was working with countries and I thought putting the data on the map  would be more visually appealing. However, it became too congested and having to hover each country to show the healthcare costs was not too appealing, which was feedback I received from my classmates. I decided to visualize the data in bar chart, but I still believe the amount of countries were still making the visualization look too cluttered. I decided then to still use a bar chart but only visualize the US healthcare costs with the top 5 highest healthcare costs in the data with the global average. 

I then decided to change the GDP per Capita vs Healthcare spending graph from multiple lines to a scatterplot. This will be able to show the United States as a clear outlier. I decided also to combine the data for GDP per Capita with the life expectancy data to also create a scatterplot. THis also shows the United States as aclear outlier in the spending but their quality of care does not show their citizens are living longer. Also, I decided to condese the death rates chart to one that compares the global average to the US, which show a huge difference. 

## References
> **You should have already included detailed references on your Shorthand story** - if so, you do not need to list them twice, unless you used additional references for specific to your writeup. Use this section to capture any additional special notes or information necessary. If there is additional information for your shorthand readers that you've placed on this page, link from Shorthand to this page. Make sure to double-check that you aren't using copyright material and that you have added / updated any citations or other content that you used to create your data story.  Make sure you have cited external sources correctly.

I used Copilot for some help on navigating Tableau. 

# Final thoughts
> You can summarize any final thoughts / reflections that don't fit well in the previous sections here.  How did it go?  What did you run out of time for, or wish you had a chance to revisit?  What were you most excited about?  Include any final reflections as you think they might help us understand your process.  If you already included such reflections elsewhere, you can delete this section. 

I felt this project was difficult at first for me and it mostly was due to naviagating the new software. This was my first time utilizing Tableau, Datawrapper, and also Shorthand, so I was learning as I was completing my project. I had trouble trying to pick the right narrative with my data, but I am thankful for the interviews I was able to do to give me better insight on what my story should be. 

I believe I was able to create a presentation I am proud while now having a better understanding on how to use the new software.
