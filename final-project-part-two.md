# Wireframes / storyboards
> Using your sketches developed last week, further develop your story outline and relevant components visually through the use of wireframing / storyboards. Using your outline as a guide, include high-fidelity, individual draft data visualizations of the critical elements of your story you want to share with your reader. Note: you can build these elements out directly in Shorthand this week if you wish.  Reminder: this template is intended to help, but it doesn't substitute for reading through the full homework assignment!  The assignment page on Canvas includes many important details for completing Part II of the final project.

# User research 

## Target audience
> Include your approach to identifying representative individuals, and who you hope to reach with your story. 

The target audience for this stroy is those who live in the United States and are suffering from health issues but cannot afford the current healthcare costs. I hope these people realize there are other, more affordable areas in the world where they can treat their illnesses. I also am ambitiously hoping to possibly reach those in the United States who can make a change in the healthcare system by seeing that people want to find an alternate to the current US healthcare system. 

## Interview script
> List the goals from your research, and the questions you intend to ask. 

| Goal | Questions to Ask |
|------|------------------|
| Find the countries with the most affordable and efficient healthcare | Do you believe the United States has the best healthcare? If not, which country do you believe does? |
| See which illness cause the most deaths in each country | Which illnesses do you believe causes the most deaths in the United States? |
| Find out the country with the most efficient healthcare by looking at the life expectancy rates | Do you believe the United States has the highest life expectancy rate in the world? |
