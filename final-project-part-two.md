# Wireframes / storyboards
> Using your sketches developed last week, further develop your story outline and relevant components visually through the use of wireframing / storyboards. Using your outline as a guide, include high-fidelity, individual draft data visualizations of the critical elements of your story you want to share with your reader. Note: you can build these elements out directly in Shorthand this week if you wish.  Reminder: this template is intended to help, but it doesn't substitute for reading through the full homework assignment!  The assignment page on Canvas includes many important details for completing Part II of the final project.

# User research 

## Target audience
> Include your approach to identifying representative individuals, and who you hope to reach with your story. 

The target audience for this stroy is those who live in the United States and are suffering from health issues but cannot afford the current healthcare costs. I hope these people realize there are other, more affordable areas in the world where they can treat their illnesses. I also am ambitiously hoping to possibly reach those in the United States who can make a change in the healthcare system by seeing that people want to find an alternate to the current US healthcare system. 

## Interview script
> List the goals from your research, and the questions you intend to ask. 

| Goal | Questions to Ask |
|------|------------------|
| Determine if the visualizations was impactful | Does anything about this visualization surprise you? |
| Seeing if the colors I chose help understanding the visualization | Are the color distracting you or do they help you to understand the visualization? |
| Deciding if I chose the correct visualization | Do you think this visualization could have been displayed differently? |
| Removing unncessary items from my visualizations | Is there any thing you do not like about this visualization? |

| Questions               | Interview 1 (briefly describe) | Interview 2 | Interview 3 |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------|-------------|
| Does anything about this visualization surprise you? | The healthcare costs per capita by country visualization does not surprise me because the United States is known for having high healthcare costs. | I am surprised by the South American ountries health care costs being higher than Europe, but the United States does not surprise me | I am not surpised by the United States high healthcare costs |
| Are the colors distracting you or do they help you understand the visualization? | The other countries being greyed out and the United States having a red bar was helpful for me to understand the death rate comparison | The red bar for the United States immediately caught my eye | The colors on the life expectancy visualization are distracting becuase I am confused what they mean |
| Do you think this visualization could have been displayed differently? | I belive a bar chart could have been better to depict the healthcare costs per capita visualization | Using a map for the healthcare costs per capita is more useful because someone will be able to where the country is located and the color scheme is helpful as well. | I believe the cancerous tumors death rate could have been displayed differently than a bar chart |
| Is there any thing you do not like about this visualization? | I thought the visualizations were straighforward and helpful | I thought the titles could have been more descriptive | I did not like how in the different death rates visualization there was not a color associated with a visualization |




# Identified changes for Part III

| Research synthesis                       | Anticipated changes for Part III                                                |
|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| The way I am displaying some visualizations could be changed | I will change my data visualizations of healthcare costs per capita from a map to a bar chart and then having a button referencing the data |
| The years of the datasets are not consistent |  I will still continue to make my analysis, but I will make a note that there was difficulty with finding recent datasets so some of them are outdated |
| I may be over-explaining my narrative instead of letting my visualization talk for me | I will reduce the amount of wording that is in my Shorthand and organize it differently instead of relying on the words |
|                                          |                                                                                 |

> ...include any final thoughts you have here. 

I believe there is still a lot of improvements needed to be made on my project.
