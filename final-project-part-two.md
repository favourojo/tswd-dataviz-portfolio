## Target audience

The target audience for this story is those who live in the United States and are suffering from health issues but are concerned they will not be able to afford the present US healthcare costs. I want these people to realize there are other, more affordable areas in the world where they can treat their illnesses. I also am ambitiously hoping to possibly reach those in the United States who can make a change in the healthcare system by seeing that people want to find an alternate to the current US healthcare system. 

## Interview script

| Goal | Questions to Ask |
|------|------------------|
| Determine if the visualizations was impactful | Does anything about any of the visualizations surprise you? |
| Seeing if the colors I chose help understanding the visualization | Are the colors on a visualization distracting you or do they help you to understand it better? |
| Deciding if I chose the correct visualization | Do you think any of the visualizations could have been displayed differently? |
| Removing unncessary items from my visualizations | Is there any thing about a visualization that you do not like? | 

## Interview findings

| Questions               | Interview 1 (briefly describe) | Interview 2 | Interview 3 |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------|-------------|
| Does anything about any of the visualizations surprise you?  | The healthcare costs per capita by country visualization does not surprise me because the United States is known for having high healthcare costs. | I am surprised by the South American countries health care costs being higher than those in Europe, but the United States is the least surprising part of the visualization | I am not surpised by the United States high healthcare costs |
| Are the colors on a visualization distracting you or do they help you to understand it better? | The other countries being greyed out and the United States having a red bar was helpful for me to understand the death rate comparison | The red bar for the United States immediately caught my eye | The colors and shapes on the life expectancy map  are distracting becuase there is no clear indication what they mean |
| Do you think any of the visualizations could have been displayed differently? | I belive a bar chart could have been better to depict the healthcare costs per capita visualization | Using a map for the healthcare costs per capita is more useful because someone will be able to tell  where the country is located and the color scheme is helpful as well. | I believe the cancerous tumors death rate data could have been displayed differently than a bar chart |
| Is there any thing about a visualization that you do not like? | I thought the visualizations were straighforward and helpful | I thought the titles of each of the death rates visualization could have been more descriptive | I did not like how in the different death rates visualizations all the other countries had grey bars |

# Identified changes for Part III

| Research synthesis                       | Anticipated changes for Part III                                                |
|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| The way I am displaying some visualizations could be changed | I will change my data visualization of healthcare costs per capita from a map to a bar chart and then having a button referencing the data |
| The years of the datasets are not consistent |  I will still continue to make my analysis, but I will make a note that there was difficulty with finding recent datasets so some of them are outdated |
| I may be over-explaining my narrative instead of letting my visualization talk for me | I will reduce the amount of wording that is in my Shorthand and organize it differently instead of relying on the words |
| Shorthand was visually pleasing | I will continue with the light blue aesthetic I used for the Shorthand design and how I displayed the media as well |

I believe there is still a lot of improvements needed to be made on my project. I do feel I am slowly bulding my narrative story and also creating my Shorthand page as well. With the feedback, I'll be focusing more on re-designing my visualizations to increase readbility. More specifically, rethinking some desgins choices I made on visulizations. I believe some visualizations I initially created may not be conveying the right story I want to tell.
